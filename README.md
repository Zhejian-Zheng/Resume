## Personal Statement
<ul>
  <li>Motivated Computer Science student (Distinction WAM) with strong teamwork and client communication skills.</li>
  <li>Hands-on experience in full-stack development across Python, Rust, Java, C++ and JavaScript, with projects involving web scraping, system simulation, and backend design. </li>
  <li>Skilled in agile workflows, Git-based version control, and cloud technologies, eager to contribute to impactful software solutions.</li>
</ul>

**School experience:** <br />
During my undergraduate studies in computer science, I laid a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, data operations, systems and many other computer technologies.

**Project and website development experience:** <br />
Beyond academics, I actively seek opportunities to broaden my horizons. For example, I participated in the jobgen.ai project, focusing on backend job crawling and job applications on Indeed. By utilizing various APIs and researching and using Python web tools, my team and I successfully achieved the project's goals. This project provided me with practical experience in web development, web scraping, and data analysis. Learning to use various tools and finding helpful APIs gave me a deeper understanding that programmers not only need to be able to write programs on a project, but also need to be able to continuously learn and use different tools. These experiences also enhanced my problem-solving and adaptability in dynamic environments. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, while completing the COMP3511 course, we were required to design a prototype for a legal website. During my free time, I implemented the front-end code for a portion of the website's core functionality (https://github.com/Zhejian-Zheng/Legal-Youth-prototype-web). This enriched my understanding of human-computer interaction and provided me with practical experience in front-end programming. This extracurricular self-experience made me realize that as programmers, we need a basic understanding of other fields before writing programs for them. This experience has enhanced my ability to more comprehensively complete initial design work when developing websites or software.

**Self-evaluation and goal:** <br />
During my university years, I participated in many team-based course projects, which gave me extensive experience in teamwork and communication. At the same time, some extracurricular projects also gave me a solid foundation in how to communicate effectively with clients and understand their needs. The extensive computer coursework provided me with a certain understanding of computer languages ​​and its function libraries in different fields. In summary, my current skills, combined with my passion for continuous learning, ensure that I can contribute effectively to your position and make the most of the opportunities it offers.
